hushHush Recruiter
Doodle is a famous software company that develops products across various IT domains. E-commerce apps,
novel cloud platform tools, DevOps tool, IT Security related tools and AI related tooling to name a few.
Doodle is well established all over the world and is in constant need of candidates as developers, senior
developers and solution architects. Doodle has traditionally relied on recruiting firms to select the best talent
from the market.
Doodle now wishes to automate this process and build an in-house solution that selects potential candidate .
Doodle wants to make the process secretive and automatically notify an candidate if he is selected for a
potential role at Doodle. The algorithm to hire a candidate cannot be deterministic as this would lead to an
discussion on social media platform from already hired candidates which will then be replicated by anyone
who wishes to apply at Doodle.
Doodle wishes to analyze data points of potentially anyone over the internet to choose the best talent. Some
example of data points are : github contributions, stackoverflow solutions (these are only examples and
should be extended)
Which data points you choose and how to create the selection algorithm is completely at your discretion. the
product must select candidates notify them, provide them with an interface where doodle will provide 3
coding question . the candidate should be able to submit the solution and a Doodle hiring manager must be
able to evaluate his solution and notify the candidate about the results.
The interface to provide the coding solutions cannot live forever and will be invalidated after a specified
period.
Please keep in mind about data privacy related issues when analyzing data points.
The hushHush recruiter must automate all steps in the process and should have as little manual efforts which
cannot be avoided.
All code must be in github.com and must be in pyhton*
As a client, Doodle will choose the strongest solution based on the their requirements.
'*' : any code which cannot be realized in python must be discussed and adequate reasons must be provided
to choose another language / framework.
